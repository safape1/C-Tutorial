/*

	Write a program that reads in a floating-point number and prints it 
	first in decimal-point notation, then in exponential notation, and then, 
	if your system supports it, p notation. Have the output use the following 
	format (the actual number of digits displayed for the exponent depends on 
	the system):

	Enter a floating-point value: 64.25
	fixed-point notation: 64.250000
	exponential notation: 6.425000e+01
	p notation: 0x1.01p+6â€œ
